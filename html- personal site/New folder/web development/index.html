  <h3>HISENCE 65H9G QUANTUM SERIES</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Like last year's H9F, the H9G is a good looking TV. It has no three-dimensional bezel, has a small chrome slide that separates the glass from the edge, and plays a slightly silver bezel at the bottom. Just below the Hisense badge in the center of the bezel below is a remote control sensor, a remote operating microphone, and an on / off microphone. There are also 10 watt ground-shot speakers provided by Dolby Atmos audio technology
</li>
<li>The 52-pound 65H9G is supported by triangular steel legs and has four VESA holes around the back for mounting. Other back-facing, externally, there are composite (RCA) video and audio ports, digital audio output, and a LAN port. To the left are three HDMI ports, two USB ports, a headphone jack, and a coaxial cable jack. The power jack sits alone to the right of the back panel. In addition to wired network connectivity, H9G offers wireless connectivity via dual-band dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi.</li>
<li>The H9G comes with the same busy remote control as the slightly lower 65H8G. It is an 8-inch wand with 39 buttons and a four-dimensional arrow controller, and offers a standard 0-9 number pad, volume buttons and up / down buttons, menu button, and video control buttons. It also provided buttons for Google Play, Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube, as well as a voice control button for Goggle Assistant. None of them are backed up, however, which makes it difficult to find the right button in the dark. Alternatively, you can also control the TV using the Android TV remote application on your phone.</li>
